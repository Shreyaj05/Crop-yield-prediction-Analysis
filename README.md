# Crop-yield-prediction-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on a global agricultural dataset to analyze crop yield patterns. Built and compared regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, KNN) using rainfall, temperature, and pesticide usage as features, and evaluated performance with R² and MSE. KNN achieved the best performance with an R² of 0.98, demonstrating its effectiveness for yield prediction.
